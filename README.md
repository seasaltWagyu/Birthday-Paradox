# Birthday-Paradox
Python code to simulate the birthday paradox and check probabilities.

Run the file, and it will print out the probability of any 2 students in a CLASS OF 38 STUDENTS (not 23 because this was made specifically to model one of my own classes). This program was made specifically to keep readability and simple modeling in mind. Yes, the code could have been shortened a lot, but the Birthday Paradox is a lot simpler when modeled with real-life things. I only made this because I did not believe the Birthday Paradox, however, I am stupid.
