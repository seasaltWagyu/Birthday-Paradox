# Birthday-Paradox
Python code to simulate the birthday paradox and check probabilities.

Run the file, and it will print out the probability of any 2 students in a CLASS OF 38 STUDENTS (not 23 because this was made specifically to model one of my own classes). I only made this because I did not believe the Birthday Paradox, however, I am stupid.
